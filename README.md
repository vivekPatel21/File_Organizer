# File_Organizer 📁
A script that organizes any folder you download into it's specific category/file type. Can be modified to meet whatever needs you want!  

## Setup  🧰
you will need to really quickly change the file paths in the script to be your User name rather than the filler name that I had placed in. This way the directory will work properly and the script will do what it is meant to.

### extra  
If you have any file types that are not supported, you can always fork this repository and make some changes and push for a either a pr, or you could also keep things private and just add some more variables to the organize.py extension.
